# Creating a Twitter Application

For the various Twitter consumer of this course, we will connect to twitter through the so-called [Filter Stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview.html). This allows to set some filter options, which defines the Tweets we are interested in. Filters can be set on Terms, Geographic Location, Language and User. 

In order to use the Twitter [Filter Stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview.html), we first have to create a Twitter application. If you don't have a Twitter user yet, you also have to create an account, which you can do from the sign in page below. To access the Twitter Application management, navigate to <http://apps.twitter.com>.

On the **Log into Twitter** screen, enter the **Username** and **Password** of your twitter handle into the corresponding fields. If you donâ€™t yet have a twitter handle, then click on the small **Sign up now** link to register at twitter.
