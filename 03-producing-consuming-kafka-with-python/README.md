# Using Confluent's Python Client for Apache Kafka
In this workshop we will learn how to use the client libraries for working with Kafka. 

### Installing the Confluent Python Client

```
pip install confluent-kafka
```

```
pip install confluent-kafka[avro]
```

### Producing Messages


```
from confluent_kafka import Producer


p = Producer({'bootstrap.servers': 'mybroker1,mybroker2'})

def delivery_report(err, msg):
    """ Called once for each message produced to indicate delivery result.
        Triggered by poll() or flush(). """
    if err is not None:
        print('Message delivery failed: {}'.format(err))
    else:
        print('Message delivered to {} [{}]'.format(msg.topic(), msg.partition()))

for data in some_data_source:
    # Trigger any available delivery report callbacks from previous produce() calls
    p.poll(0)

    # Asynchronously produce a message, the delivery report callback
    # will be triggered from poll() above, or flush() below, when the message has
    # been successfully delivered or failed permanently.
    p.produce('mytopic', data.encode('utf-8'), callback=delivery_report)

# Wait for any outstanding messages to be delivered and delivery report
# callbacks to be triggered.
p.flush()
```
